What is middleware?,Middleware is software that enables one or more kinds of communication or connectivity between two or more applications or application components in a distributed network. By making it easier to connect applications that weren't designed to connect with one another - and providing functionality to connect them in intelligent ways - middleware streamlines application development and speeds time to market.,0.252172563625 0.255586592179 0.492240844196

What is SOA?,"SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces. Services use common interface standards and an architectural pattern so they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications.  This removes tasks from the application developer who previously redeveloped or duplicated existing functionality or had to know how to connect or provide interoperability with existing functions.",0.168989184692 0.17127703827 0.659733777038
What is an MB (Message Broker)?,A message broker (also known as an integration broker or interface engine[1]) is an intermediary computer program module that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver. Message brokers are elements in telecommunication or computer networks where software applications communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages. Message brokers are a building block of message-oriented middleware (MOM) but are typically not a replacement for traditional middleware like MOM and remote procedure call (RPC).,0.046993436734 0.0482360516476 0.0985393626515 0.313534335709 0.179162477548 0.313534335709
What is an MQ (Message Queue)?,"A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures.

What is IBM Websphere Message Queue (WMQ)?,"IBM WebSphere MQ is messaging for applications. It sends messages across networks of diverse components.

What is disaster recovery and business continuity,Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.,0.0282114258798 0.0290749837382 0.213444586502 0.213444586502 0.0889352443757 0.213444586502 0.213444586502
What is an API?,"APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.

What does API stand for?,"API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.",0.0784865755682 0.201057474421 0.150793105816 0.452379317448 0.117283526746
How does API work?,"API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client. ",0.157678244973 0.303930530165 0.234460694698 0.303930530165
What are REST APIs?,"REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP. The main feature of REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.",0.0850235212462 0.0917328603378 0.411621809208 0.411621809208
What are API Integrations?,"API integrations are software components that automatically update data between clients and servers. Some examples of API integrations are when automatic data sync to the cloud from your phone image gallery, or the time and date automatically sync on your laptop when you travel to another time zone.

What are Authentication Tokens?,"These are used to authorize users to make the API call. Authentication tokens check that the users are who they claim to be and that they have access rights for that particular API call. For example, when you log in to your email server, your email client uses authentication tokens for secure access.",0.0850235212462 0.0917328603378 0.411621809208 0.411621809208
What are API Keys?,API keys verify the program or application making the API call. They identify the application and ensure it has the access rights required to make the particular API call.

What is Python?,"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.",0.168989184692 0.17127703827 0.659733777038
