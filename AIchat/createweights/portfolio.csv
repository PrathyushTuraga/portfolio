What is middleware?,Middleware is software that enables one or more kinds of communication or connectivity between two or more applications or application components in a distributed network. By making it easier to connect applications that weren't designed to connect with one another - and providing functionality to connect them in intelligent ways - middleware streamlines application development and speeds time to market.
How middleware works?,"At the most basic level, middleware enables developers to build applications without having to create a custom integration every time they need to connect to application components (services or microservices), data sources, computing resources or devices."
What is entreprise application middleware integration?,"Enterprise application integration middleware lets an organization establish an enterprise integration hub - a standardized way to connect all applications, application components, business processes and back-end data sources in the extended enterprise."
What is an ESB?,"An ESB, or enterprise service bus, is an architectural pattern whereby a centralized software component performs integrations between applications.  It performs transformations of data models, handles connectivity, performs message routing, converts communication protocols and potentially manages the composition of multiple requests. The ESB can make these integrations and transformations available as a service interface for reuse by new applications. "
What is SOA?,"SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces. Services use common interface standards and an architectural pattern so they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications.  This removes tasks from the application developer who previously redeveloped or duplicated existing functionality or had to know how to connect or provide interoperability with existing functions."
What is an MB (Message Broker)?,A message broker (also known as an integration broker or interface engine[1]) is an intermediary computer program module that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver. Message brokers are elements in telecommunication or computer networks where software applications communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages. Message brokers are a building block of message-oriented middleware (MOM) but are typically not a replacement for traditional middleware like MOM and remote procedure call (RPC).
What is an MQ (Message Queue)?,"A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads."
What is IBM Websphere Message Queue (WMQ)?,"IBM WebSphere MQ is messaging for applications. It sends messages across networks of diverse components. Your application connects to IBM WebSphere MQ to send or receive a message. IBM WebSphere MQ handles the different processors, operating systems, subsystems, and communication protocols it encounters in transferring the message. If a connection or a processor is temporarily unavailable, IBM WebSphere MQ queues the message and forwards it when the connection is back online."
What is IBM Websphere Message Broker (WMB)?,"IBM WebSphere Message Broker is the old name for IBM Integration Bus, IBM's integration broker from the WebSphere product family that allows business information to flow between disparate applications across multiple hardware and software platforms. Rules can be applied to the data flowing through the message broker to route and transform the information. The product is an Enterprise Service Bus providing connectivity between applications and services in a service-oriented architecture."
What is IIB (IBM Integration Bus)?,"You can use IBM® Integration Bus to connect applications together, regardless of the message formats or protocols that they support. This connectivity means that your diverse applications can interact and exchange data with other applications in a flexible, dynamic, and extensible infrastructure. IBM Integration Bus routes, transforms, and enriches messages from one location to any other location."
What is IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE)?,"IBM App Connect Enterprise (abbreviated as IBM ACE, formerly known as IBM Integration Bus or WebSphere Message Broker) is IBM's premier integration software offering, allowing business information to flow between disparate applications across multiple hardware and software platforms. Rules can be applied to the data flowing through user-authored integrations to route and transform the information. The product can be used as an Enterprise Service Bus supplying a communication channel between applications and services in a service-oriented architecture."
What is Azure?,"The Azure cloud platform is more than 200 products and cloud services designed to help you bring new solutions to life—to solve today’s challenges and create the future. Build, run, and manage applications across multiple clouds, on-premises, and at the edge, with the tools and frameworks of your choice."
What is Cloud Computing?,"Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)."
What is Cyber Security?,"Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories."
What is network Security?,"Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware."
What is application security?,"Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed."
What is Information Security?,"Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit."
What is disaster recovery and business continuity,Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.
What is an API?,"APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone."
What does API stand for?,"API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses."
How does API work?,"API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client. "
What are REST APIs?,"REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP. The main feature of REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page."
What are API Integrations?,"API integrations are software components that automatically update data between clients and servers. Some examples of API integrations are when automatic data sync to the cloud from your phone image gallery, or the time and date automatically sync on your laptop when you travel to another time zone. Enterprises can also use them to efficiently automate many system functions."
What are Authentication Tokens?,"These are used to authorize users to make the API call. Authentication tokens check that the users are who they claim to be and that they have access rights for that particular API call. For example, when you log in to your email server, your email client uses authentication tokens for secure access."
What are API Keys?,API keys verify the program or application making the API call. They identify the application and ensure it has the access rights required to make the particular API call. API keys are not as secure as tokens but they allow API monitoring in order to gather data on usage. You may have noticed a long string of characters and numbers in your browser URL when you visit different websites. This string is an API key the website uses to make internal API calls.
What are the different types of services offered in the cloud?,"Iaas, Paas, Saas"
What is Iaas?,"In infrastructure as a service, you get the raw hardware from your cloud provider as a service i.e you get a server which you can configure with your own will. (Azure VM, Amazon EC2)"
What is Paas?,"Platform as a Service, gives you a platform to publish without giving the access to the underlying software or OS. (Mobile Apps, Web Apps in Azure)"
What is Saas?,"You get software as a service in Azure, i.e no infrastructure, no platform, simple software that you can use without purchasing it. (Salesforce, Dropbox, Cisco Webex)"
What are the different cloud deployment models?,"Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud"
What is Public Cloud?,The infrastructure is owned by your cloud provider and the server that you are using could be a multi-tenant system.
What is Private Cloud?,"The infrastructure is owned by you or your cloud provider gives you that service exclusively. For eg: Hosting your website on your servers, or hosting your website with the cloud provider on a dedicated server."
What is Hybrid Cloud?,"When you use both Public Cloud, Private Cloud together, it is called Hybrid Cloud. For Example: Using your in-house servers for confidential data, and the public cloud for hosting your company’s public facing website. This type of setup would be a hybrid cloud."
What is Python?,"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed."
What is Java?,"Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc."
What are Microservices?,"Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams. Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features."
What is Docker?,"Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run."
How Docker works?,"Docker works by providing a standard way to run your code. Docker is an operating system for containers. Similar to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating system of a server. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start, or stop containers."
What is Docker Container?,"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."
What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?,"Microsoft Azure is a world-renown cloud platform for SMBs to large scale business, while Kubernetes is a modern-day approach that is rapidly becoming the regular methodology to manage cloud-native applications in a production environment. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) has brought both solutions together that allow customers to create fully-managed Kubernetes clusters quickly and easily. Azure Kubernetes Service offers provisioning, scaling, and upgrades of resources as per requirement or demand without any downtime in the Kubernetes cluster and the best thing about AKS is that you don’t require deep knowledge and expertise in container orchestration to manage AKS."
